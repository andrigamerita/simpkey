	h2 Help
	p This is a great page to answer frequently asked questions about using Simpkey!
	h3 I feel like the timeline is stuck.
	p Simpkey does not have a real-time timeline. The latest timeline is not displayed until the page is reloaded, like when you make a post or a reaction.
	p You should be able to reload the timeline by manually pressing a button such as home local, so please do that. 
		span(style="font-size:0.8em; opacity:0.4") (Manual reloading used to be the norm.)
	h3 What is CW?
	p It is a function to hide the body of a note. It can be used to add annotations, so use it for notes on slightly harsh stories, baggage, one-shot gags, and so on.
	p Note that even if you fill in the annotation field, it will not be applied if the CW checkbox is unchecked, so please do not forget to check it!
	h3 Hashtags are displayed as "Page not found".
	p It's not implemented yet. Sorry.
	h3 What is the emoji before the time in the note?
	p These are marks that indicate the extent of the note's publication. They have the following meanings respectively.
	ul
		li 🌐 - Public. Public range that anyone can see.
		li 🏠 - Home. Only visible on the timeline of the poster's followers and on their own user page.
		li 🔒 - Followers. Shows only on the timeline of the poster's followers.
